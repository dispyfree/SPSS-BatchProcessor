# SPSS-BatchProcessor
The _SPSS BatchProcessor_ is a tool for automation developed and used within the working group "Psychologische Diagnostik. Differentielle Psychologie und Pers√∂nlichkeitspsychologie" of the University of Kiel. 

The tool automates the execution of SPSS scripts on arbitrarily large sets of input files. In particular, it enables to process a number of (subject) files without executing each one manually - and also without creating a corresponding syntax file for each and every subject. The tool supports both SPSS and PSPP. 

## Features
* Applying a given SPSS file on a given set of (subject) files
* Storage of all options in configuration files
* Extracting information from filenames and providing it in syntax files (i.e. subject shorthands, conditions ...)
* Mass generation of syntax files
* Simulation of execution 
* Capture and storage of SPSS output
* Accumulation of data files (grouping of subjects)

## Requirements
The BatchProcessor is a collection of Python scripts. As such, it can be run with any distribution of SPSS 24/PSPP. There are no requirements beyond those already imposed by SPSS/PSPP.
